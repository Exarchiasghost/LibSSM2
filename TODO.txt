*) More NUnit tests and test code improvements.
Good to show usability, find bugs and add/improve error checking
especially for corner cases.


*) Override ToString() for debugging.
Also enhance and test Equals, GetHashCode methods,
might be useful in some cases.


*) Add more init data functionality.
Should provide system type strings like "2.0L DOHC" as well as
easy access to capability flag bits.
I already did something similar, just need to get it integrated here.
Not sure yet whether to add members in Ssm2InitResponse packet class
or create an additional non-packet class.


*) Another two subclasses to implement
Write-Block-Request (B0) and Write-Block-Response (F0).
Anyone needs these at all? Won't be much work though.
Are those used for flashing (firmware update)?
Both command bytes are already included in Ssm2Command enumeration.


*) Conditional compilation instructions to only include needed functionality.
Might be useful to reduce assembly size for limited devices (PocketPC).
E.g. only include necessary types for sampling (Init, Read-Addresses)
since most applications on small devices won't do stuff like
maintenance operations.
